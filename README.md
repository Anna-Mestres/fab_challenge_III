>Goal:
Tool for collectively reflecting on the effectiveness or meaningfulness of urban (public) design bins by the citizens of the community.

## Areas of Interest

Public design is supposed to be democratic but they often don't consider the community designed they are designing for. For example, these new garbage bins. How does the public actually feel about them, are they "good" or effective designs?

**The theory behind the bins:**

* First, new lower containers will be progressively incorporated to improve the visibility of pedestrians and, with it, their safety. In addition, they will have different sizes to better adapt to the needs of each neighborhood and the mouths will be calibrated to the corresponding residue.

* As of March 7, this new system will be implemented in the first five districts: Ciutat Vella, Eixample, Gràcia, Sant Andreu and Sant Martí. Deployment will be carried out gradually over the following weeks incorporating the new staff and all vehicles and services. From the month of September, implementation will be made in the rest of the city, in the districts of Sants-Montjuïc, Les Corts, Sarrià-Sant Gervasi, Horta-Guinardó and Nou Barris.

## Interaction

### Ethical design

In order to address the ethical design of our artefact we have identified two main themes.

* Understanding of how people feel about and use public design.

* Collective collection and feedback of data.

In the first case, we know that urban designs are studied and tested directly with the city. But interaction in terms of questions and answers is not as widely used. So not only to collect information from each other, but also to make society aware of public opinion, as we see in the second case. In this way, we can design and generate a city for all. 

### Protocols

## Process

We started by making a list of parts we needed to make in order to identify tasks and schedules. For the 3D design, we knew we needed a case to hold the electronics and speaker together (lives inside the garbage can) and either a button

In terms of functionality, we discussed what would be the best way for people to castntheir vote. Since the garbage bin is typically seen as an unsanitary place, we knew people would not want to touch the bin, so we decided to eliminate the option of capacitive sensors. We also explored using infrared sensors that would be attached to the outside of the bin and detect the movement or position of the person., but the sensitivity would be 

### Design Decisions

### Flow Chart

![Updated Flow Chart](images/)

Anna developed the flow chart in two parts. The first part is straight forward as there is one input and output. The part 2 got more complex because it had to consider four outputs (audio) based on an average of collected data (yes or no inputs). We later corrected this flow char to...


### Electronics

In mapping out the electronic components, we had 2 options: the first was to use ESP boards that are connected with wires to the foot pedal
